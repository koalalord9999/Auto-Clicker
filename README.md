# Auto-Clicker
This program was created over the course of a day and a half, with little experience into the happenings of how to make this program work.
I wanted this so I could spam click in minecraft, but not for PVP gain, which is why there is a right click option. This program as long 
as ran in Administrator, can be used like any other auto clicker, and be specified how many time you want to click, the delay between 
clicks, and everything of the like.



You can use this program however you like, but if you get in trouble, I hold NO responsibilities over it.
You can edit this program as well if you wish, but if you publish it, please atleast give me credit, for the original template :)


Clicker.exe in the /release folder is all you need to run this, you may also need some 3.5 .NET runtime or something like that, I don't know the technical side of this,
